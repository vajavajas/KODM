      <h2>About KODM Cybersecurity</h2>
      <p>
        KODM was founded by Vaja Kodoshvili, a cybersecurity visionary from the small Georgian town of Gori.
        What began as a one-man mission to protect local businesses from cyber threats has now grown into one of the region’s
        most trusted and innovative cybersecurity companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since its humble beginnings, KODM has focused on creating powerful, user-friendly tools that help individuals,
        enterprises, and governments secure their digital environments. Vaja’s deep knowledge of cyber defense and relentless
        curiosity led him to develop original threat detection algorithms and training systems long before mainstream adoption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, KODM works with clients across multiple continents, offering services in penetration testing, digital forensics,
        secure infrastructure design, and cybersecurity education. Its team of researchers and engineers continues to push
        boundaries in artificial intelligence-based threat mitigation and real-time security monitoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        But through all the growth, KODM remains grounded in its roots — a company built not in Silicon Valley, but in a
        community that values resilience, innovation, and trust. Vaja Kodoshvili’s mission lives on in every line of code:
        <strong>“Protect those who can’t protect themselves.”</strong>
